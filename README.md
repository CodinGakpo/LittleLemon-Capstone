Meta: Back-End Developer Capstone
▷ This is the final assignment of the Meta Backend Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera

Throughout this project, I've explored various aspects of back-end development, including database management, API design, authentication, and optimization. By tackling real-world challenges and implementing industry best practices, I've honed my abilities to architect and deploy back-end solutions that meet the needs of modern applications.

Thanks for taking the time to review this project! My hope is that it sparks inspiration and provides helpful guidance for other aspiring back-end developers as they navigate their own paths in the exciting world of software development.

Peer review 🧐
▷ I've got a couple of folks looking over my code, and before they grade it, they're checking out things like:

Did I use Django to dish out those web pages?
Did I stash Ir project in a Git repo?
Does Ir app link up the backend with MySQL?
Did I hook up those menu and table booking APIs?
Have I set things up so folks can sign up and log in?
Did I write some unit tests for your app?
And can someone fire up Insomnia and give your API a spin?
